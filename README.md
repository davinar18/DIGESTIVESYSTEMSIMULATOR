# 🧠 Digestive System Simulation

An interactive and educational walkthrough of the human digestive system, built using `cmu_graphics` in Python. Designed to engage users in learning how food is processed in the body—through visuals, quizzes, and even a mini enzyme game!

---

## 📌 Overview

This simulation lets users:
- Walk through key digestive organs (mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, rectum)
- Learn about enzymes and digestion through animations and interactive visuals
- Drag and drop foods to see their nutrition facts
- Customize the body (age, weight, height) to simulate different experiences
- Test their knowledge with a quiz
- Play a 2-player game mimicking enzyme activity and membrane control

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Make biology engaging and interactive for students
- Reinforce classroom learning with simulations
- Promote health literacy in a fun, visual way
